# liveconvolver
A Cabbage plugin wrapping a Csound instrument basaed around the liveconvolver opcode.
Its intended use is to do convolution of two live sources. IR updates can be triggered in various ways.

To run:
Compile as a VST, using the latest version of Cabbage (Win/OSX/Linux)
Load as a VST on your preferred VST host. If you need a DAW recommendation, Reaper is great.
