# liveconvolver and tvconv
Cabbage plugins wrapping a Csound instrument based around the liveconvolver and tvconv opcodes.
The intended use is to do convolution of two live sources. IR updates can be triggered in various ways.

To run:
Compile as a VST, using the latest version of Cabbage (Win/OSX/Linux)
Load as a VST on your preferred VST host. If you need a DAW recommendation, Reaper is great.
